## ðŸš§ Challenges

- Implementing a smooth **list-to-grid** and **grid-to-list** transition was challenging. I found it could be done using the **GSAP Flip plugin**, but since I havenâ€™t worked with Flip before and time was limited, I chose not to spend time learning it during this assessment. Instead, I created an alternative transition to keep the switch smooth and responsive.

- Creating an **infinite drag experience** in the grid view was also challenging. I implemented the drag functionality using the **GSAP Draggable plugin**, but couldnâ€™t achieve true infinite dragging. In hindsight, I might have needed to use a library like **Swiper** to achieve the desired infinite effect.
